A favorite quote from an old friend.

<blockquote>

I really admire that there are people of all ages that are able to get along, without awkwardness, without serious fighting, and share a common interest, whilst in completely different parts of the world.

I mean, isn't it just amazing that we all have a different background, a different upbringing, a different future, and yet we all united at this point in time to share an interest, as futile as it may seem, and be passionate about it?

**What a life!**
