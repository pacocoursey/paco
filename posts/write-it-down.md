My crappy superpower is solving difficult problems as I'm falling asleep. Doesn't sound too bad, right? Here's the catch: I always convince myself I don't need to write the solution down.

It's 1:18 AM. I just figured it out. The answer is so simple, I can't believe it took me this long. Do I blind myself opening my phone to write it down? No, I can finally sleep now! There's no way I'll forget.


It's 8:32 AM. I can't believe I've done this again.

I have a new policy: **write it down.** Every single time. No matter if the idea comes to me in the shower, the middle of a dream, or in a conversation.

Most of my ideas are bad. But this way I'll never miss an opportunity.
