> The sea is everything. It covers seven-tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and life-giving. It is an immense desert place where man is never lonely, for he senses the weaving of Creation on every hand. It is the physical embodiment of a supernatural existence... For the sea is itself nothing but **love and emotion**.

> Solitude is also the key to true loving in our relationships. When we have a part of ourselves that is firm, confident, and alone, we don't need another person to fill us. We know that we have private spaces full of goodness and self-worth, and we grant those we love the same. We do not try to pry into every corner of their lives or to fill the emptiness inside us with their presence.
>
> People who don't know solitude never understand this. They are obsessed with the loneliness in their lives. They make unrealistic demands on those they love because they look to them to fill this loneliness. In the name of Love they smother those around them with their needs and expectations. They demand total absorption as part of a relationship, and they fear the freedom of those to whom they try to give their love.

> In fact, what they want is for the people they love to conform to the shape of their own emptiness. The spaces in their lives, which should be rich, private sanctuaries, are really nothing more than vast longings waiting to be filled.

> You only get one shot at life, which is scary. But it sets you free. If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what that purpose is.

> Everybody has wished for an afterlife at times. But that has no more importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or to have a better-shaped mouth. It was in the same order of things.

> I like being alone. I have control over my own space. Therefore, in order to win me over, your presence has to be better than my solitude. You're not competing with another person, you're competing with my comfort zone.

> Fixed-mindset people feel smart when they don’t make mistakes, growth-mindset people feel smart when they struggle with something for a long time and then finally figure it out.
